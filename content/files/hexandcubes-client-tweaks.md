<br>

Since version 3.0 this modpack is not compatible with Optifine, since it uses Rubidium (forge fork of sodium) which
includes similar, and often better performance improvements than Optifine. Modpack supports custom shaders, dynamic
lighting and zooming.

**Caution: Enabling Quark modules other than client, will break modpack's compatibility with vanilla multiplayer server.**

##### Known Issues:

- Items in JEI are not being rendered unless the search bar is populated
- Some Quark items may be visible in the creative inventory on Multiplayer servers

If you're using the [PolyMC Launcher](https://polymc.org/) it is recommended to use the built-in CurseForge integration,
instead of installing the modpack using the downloaded .zip file.
