This simple add-on changes the theme of the scrollbar on YouTube from Dark to Dark.
It uses a dynamic scrollbar feature in Firefox that automatically makes the scrollbar Dark, when website's body background property is set to a Dark color.

This addon has been deprecated, and is no longer needed, since YouTube added official support for Firefox's automatic Dark scrollbars.

Works on Firefox 72 or newer.
